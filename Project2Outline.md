--Review instructions for Project 2--
An idea of the dataset you'd like to look at:
	I am going to use the same dataset I scraped for Project 1, NCAA men's basketball box scores for the 2013-14 season, (hopefully) with the addition of missing data from 1/18/2014 that was omitted from Project 1 because it repeatedly crashed my scraper.
The category or categories you'd like to predict:
	I'd like to predict a player's conference based on their height, year and box scores stats (minutes, points, rebounds, assists) throughout the season. Alternatively, I might try to predict players' box score stats (points and/or rebounds per game) based on their heights and conference affiliation.
